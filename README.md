# Mathis Villaret

M1 — ENSAE Paris × HEC Paris  
Quantitative Finance

---

I combine a strong background in **mathematics, probability, statistics and econometrics** with a deep focus on **financial markets and quantitative modelling**.  
My work revolves around extracting structure from market data to build **pricing-oriented and risk-oriented statistical models**.

---

### Focus Areas
- Volatility modelling and implied surface construction  
  ▸ calibration from illiquid option markets and activity-based data  
  ▸ liquidity-aware interpolation for implied volatility surfaces  
  ▸ benchmarking stochastic models vs ML architectures for volatility prediction  

- Option pricing & risk
  ▸ sensitivities & Greeks  
  ▸ factor and risk-premia modelling  

- Time-series econometrics for markets
  ▸ regime switching & structural breaks  
  ▸ macro-linked modelling of asset returns (e.g., gold-price dynamics project)  

- Systematic & data-driven strategies
  ▸ statistical modelling for signal construction  
  ▸ backtesting pipelines and robustness assessment

# Mathis Villaret

ENSAE Paris × HEC Paris  
Quantitative Finance

---

I combine a strong background in **mathematics, probability, statistics and econometrics** with a deep focus on **financial markets and quantitative modelling**.  

**I transform financial theory into code—leveraging educational implementations to master the nuances of quantitative finance while deploying high-fidelity models and strategies to solve sophisticated market problems.**

### Focus Areas
- Volatility modelling and implied surface construction
  ▸ calibration of skew and volatility term structure for S&P500 options 
  ▸ calibration from illiquid option markets and activity-based data  
  ▸ liquidity-aware interpolation for implied volatility surfaces 
  ▸ benchmarking stochastic models vs ML architectures for volatility prediction 

- Option pricing & risk
  ▸ sensitivities & Greeks  
  ▸ factor and risk-premia modelling  

- Time-series econometrics for markets
  ▸ regime switching & structural breaks  
  ▸ macro-linked modelling of asset returns (e.g., gold-price dynamics project)  

- Systematic & data-driven strategies
  ▸ statistical modelling for signal construction  
  ▸ backtesting pipelines and robustness assessment

ENSAE Paris × HEC Paris  
Quantitative Finance

I combine a strong background in **mathematics, probability, statistics and econometrics** with a deep focus on **financial markets and quantitative modelling**.  
My work revolves around extracting structure from market data to build **pricing-oriented and risk-oriented statistical models**.

---

### Focus Areas
- Volatility modelling and implied surface construction  
- Option pricing and risk sensitivities  
- Time-series econometrics for market dynamics  
- Systematic and data-driven strategies  

---

### Recent Work
- Calibration of **volatility surfaces** for illiquid derivatives using market and activity data  
- **Liquidity-aware interpolation schemes** for implied volatility  
- Benchmarking **jump-diffusion stochastic models vs ML architectures** for volatility prediction  

---

### Toolbox
Python (NumPy · pandas · statsmodels · scikit-learn · matplotlib)  
Jupyter · Time-series modelling · Volatility & risk · Backtesting prototypes

---

### Selected Projects
- **Benchmark_Salaires_Superbrut_Supernet** — Python pipeline for benchmarking salary levels across French regions and industries through scraping, cleaning, statistical comparison and visualization.
- **Volatility Modelling (Private Project)** — Construction and calibration of implied volatility surfaces for illiquid options markets using alternative data; comparison of stochastic and machine-learning approaches for volatility prediction. *(Private repository)*
- **Gold-Price Dynamics (Incoming)** — Econometric study of gold returns using macro factors, volatility regimes and structural break detection. *(Work in progress)*
